I'll help you walk through using Synthea to generate this cardiovascular health dataset. Based on the documentation from [Synthea's GitHub repository](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea), here's how you can accomplish this:

### Overview of Synthea
Synthea is a synthetic patient generator that creates realistic (but not real) patient data following clinical protocols and demographic patterns. It simulates entire life histories of synthetic patients, including:
- Demographics
- Medical conditions
- Medications
- Vital signs
- Lab results
- Clinical encounters

### Steps to Generate Your Dataset

1. **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea.git
cd synthea
./gradlew build check test
```

2. **Configure Properties**
Create a custom properties file (e.g., `custom.properties`) to ensure you get the data you need:

```properties
exporter.csv.export = true
exporter.csv.folder_per_run = false
generate.only_alive_patients = false
generate.demographics.race.enabled = true
generate.demographics.ethnicity.enabled = true
generate.demographics.socioeconomic.enabled = true
```

3. **Configure Demographics**
- Synthea uses Census data by default, but you can customize the demographics
- For Asian subgroups, you'll need to modify the demographics file in `src/main/resources/demographics.csv`

4. **Run Synthea**
```bash
./run_synthea -p 1000 -c custom.properties

Or, to generate a larger dataset:
```bash
./run_synthea -p 10000 -g M -a 40-140 --exporter.fhir.export=false --exporter.csv.export=true
```
This generates 1000 patients. Add more options as needed:
- `-s <seed>` for reproducibility
- `-a <min>-<max>` for age range
- `-g M/F` for specific gender

5. **Relevant Output Files**
The generated CSV files will contain:
- `patients.csv`: Demographics, death info
- `observations.csv`: Blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar
- `conditions.csv`: Diabetes history
- `medications.csv`: Hypertension treatments
- `procedures.csv`: Related procedures
- `encounters.csv`: Clinical visits

### Customizing Disease Modules

To ensure you get all the cardiovascular characteristics you need, you might want to examine and possibly modify these modules:
- `cardiovascular_disease.json`
- `metabolic_syndrome_care.json`
- `diabetes.json`
- `hypertension.json`

### Getting Specific Data Points

Your requested data points map to Synthea's output as follows:

1. **Vital Signs**
- Blood pressure: Found in observations (LOINC codes: 8480-6, 8462-4)
- Blood sugar: Found in observations (LOINC code: 2339-0)

2. **Lab Results**
- Cholesterol panel: Found in observations
  - Total: LOINC 2093-3
  - HDL: LOINC 2085-9
  - LDL: LOINC 2089-1

3. **Demographics**
- Age: Calculated from birth_date in patients.csv
- Sex: Direct field in patients.csv
- Race: Direct field in patients.csv

4. **Clinical History**
- Diabetes: Found in conditions.csv
- Smoking status: Found in observations.csv
- Hypertension treatment: Found in medications.csv

5. **Mortality Data**
- Death date: In patients.csv
- Cause of death: In patients.csv

### Custom Statistics Integration

If you have specific statistics about cardiovascular health characteristics that you want to incorporate:

1. Create a custom module file in `src/main/resources/modules`
2. Modify the transition probabilities and distributions to match your statistics
3. Update the `synthea.properties` file to include your custom module

Would you like me to provide more specific details about any of these steps or help you set up a custom module for your statistics?
